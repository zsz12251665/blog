<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>The description of the problem is too simple. I even don't know the data range. So at the beginning, I just followed the problem and simulate it. I was worried about the accuracy so I tried to use integers to keep the number. But soon I found it impossible because the <data value="v{i}o{!}"></data> is so big. So I use double instead. To my surprise, It is accepted. </p>
