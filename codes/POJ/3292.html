<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>Sorry for the couple of no-update months. This is a problem about prime numbers. However, I spent a lot of time to avoid <abbr title="Time Limit Exceeded">TLE</abbr> until I found the correct solution. </p>
	<p>First of all, I thought of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, such a efficient sieve of prime with an <data value="o{O}o{(}v{n}o{}o{lg}p{2}v{n}o{)}"></data> time complexity. Then after getting a number <data value="v{n}"></data>, try every pair of H-primes that fix it. That is obviously not fast enough. So later I used the Sieve of Euler, an <data value="o{O}o{(}v{n}o{)}"></data> sieve, to filter the prime numbers. It didn't make any sence. That is the Soultion 1. </p>
	<p>Later, I found that if I could preprocess the H-primes, why not preprocess the H-semi-primes at the same time? So that is the Solution 2 with <abbr title="Accepted">AC</abbr>. </p>
	<p>P. S. As same as <a href="/codes/?oj=POJ&pid=1007">POJ 1007</a>, the <abbr title="Free Pascal Compiler">FPC</abbr> of POJ didn't work well when I tried to verify that the Pascal Code is able to solve the problem, so the Pascal Code remains unverified. </p>
	<p>P. P. S. On 15:19, 10 November, 2017, the Pascal Code was submitted again and now it is proofed that the code of Solution 2 is correct. </p>
