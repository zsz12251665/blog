<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>It was one year and a half since my last Codeforces Round. But this is a memorable round because I was attending it in Hong Kong! Just in the apartment of my classmate Wei Jiaxi! </p>
	<p>So after you read the description of Problem A, you might have found that the other dollar bills are multiple times of the 1 dollar bill and the other euro bills can be replaced by several 5 euro bills. So we just need to think about this two kinds of bills. So now we focus on the 1 dollar bills and the 5 euro bills. We can simply enumerate the number of 5 euro bills (enumerating 1 dollar bills is also valid but it might worth less so the number will be bigger) and then exchange the rest of the rubles to 1 dollar bills and find out the minimum numbers of unused rubles. </p>
