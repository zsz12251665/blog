	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>The problem is very simple. As you have seen <data value="c{0}o{&le;}v{l}o{,}v{r}o{,}v{a}o{&le;}c{100}"></data>, you can even use a <abbr title="Brute Force">BF</abbr> to solve the problem just like Solution 1. You decide which hand each ambidexter should use to maximize the number of the players. </p>
	<p>However, you can also solve the problem in <data value="o{O}o{(}c{1}o{)}"></data> as Solution 2 does. Suppose that there are more right-handers than left-handers (actually there are). If there are more right-handers than the other two, we could only have twice number of left-handers and ambidexters. Otherwise we could split the rest of ambidexters into two halves to enlarge the two groups. </p>
