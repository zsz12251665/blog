<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>Yesterday, I joined the <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/950/">Codeforces Round #469 (Div. 2)</a>, which is my first Codeforces contest. Here are some of my solution. </p>
	<p>When I saw the problem, I notice that <math>c{1}o{&le;}v{n}o{&le;}c{10}p{18}</math>. "It must be an <math>o{O}o{(}v{q}o{}o{lg}v{n}o{)}</math> problem." I thought, "or it can't be as large as <math>c{10}p{18}</math>." Of cource we could not preprocess all <math>v{n}</math> numbers before we read the questions because we just had 2 seconds. Then I tried simulating the operations on my notebook. while simulating, I realized that the operations are retrospective. For example, if we wanted to know the second number in the array, we could ask ourselves what the <math>o{(}v{n}o{+}c{1}o{)}</math>-th number is. And if I wanted the <math>v{q}</math>-th one, the answer would be the <math>o{(}v{n}o{+}f{v{q}l{}c{2}}o{)}</math>-th one. What's more, the time complexity of the algorithm is <math>o{O}o{(}o{lg}v{n}o{)}</math>. So the problem is solved. </p>
