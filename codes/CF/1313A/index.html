	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>This problem is quite easy. You try every combination and count the numbers. The only problem is that in some cases like "2 4 2", you might be unable to achieve the maximum number due to the order you try. So I highly recommend to sort the numbers before you try (just like my codes) or deal with them separately. If you are not confident, you can try all <data value="c{2}p{c{7}}"></data> possible combinations of combinations to get the correct answer. </p>
