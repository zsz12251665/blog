<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>This problem is interesting, but not difficult. First of all, there are only 4 squares <math>c{2}o{&times;}c{2}</math> which all of them has covered the cell at the center. So it doesn't matter whatever the number in this cell is. As a result, there are <math>v{n}</math> kinds of possible values at the center. Second, the four cells at the corner are just covered by one square <math>c{2}o{&times;}c{2}</math>. So when we add a number to anyone of them, we neede to add the same number to the other three. That means there are <math>o{(}v{n}o{-}v{k}o{)}</math> kinds of possible values at the corners, which <math>v{k}</math> means the difference of the maximum one and the minimum one of the values at the corners in a valid square <math>c{3}o{&times;}c{3}</math>. We can infer that <math>v{k}</math> also equals the difference of the maximum value and the minimum value of <math>v{a}o{+}v{b}</math>, <math>v{a}o{+}v{c}</math>, <math>v{b}o{+}v{d}</math> and <math>v{b}o{+}v{d}</math>. Last of all, according to the rule of product, the number of distinct valid squares should be <math>v{n}o{(}v{n}o{-}v{k}o{)}</math>. </p>
