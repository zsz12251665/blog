	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>To make the product is not 0, we only need to make sure that there is no 0 in the sequence. And if we find the sum is 0, all we need to do is to add 1 to a non-negative-one element to keep the product not being 0 and make the sum become 1. However, we don't need to which element is not -1. And there must be an element which is not -1 when the sum is 0, otherwise the sum will not be 0. </p>
