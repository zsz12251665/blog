		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<section>
			<p>I'm so stupid that I <abbr title="Wrong Answer">WA</abbr> twice and <abbr title="Runtime Error">RE</abbr> once. </p>
			<p>This problem is solved by a greedy algorithm. Obviously, we can infer that each band that Polycarp likes will perform <var>&lfloor;/#n#/#m#/&rfloor;</var> songs, which is the minimum value among <var>{#b#(_1_), #b#(_2_), ..., #b#(_m_)}</var>. So the songs that is not performed by the bands which he likes or the bands which have performed over <var>&lfloor;/#n#/#m#/&rfloor;</var> songs should be replaced. After setting a counter array while input, which is the array <var>#b#</var> in the problem, we can get which songs need to be replaced and which bands need to sing more songs. So the second step is replaced the particular songs with particular bands until every bands which Polycarp likes will sing at least <var>&lfloor;/#n#/#m#/&rfloor;</var> songs. At the same time, you can count the number of changes too. </p>
			<p>My first WA is made because I think that all the songs in the list need to be sung by the bands that Polycarp likes after the changes. It caused the second one that I put the counter at the wrong place where it counts all the songs that need to be replaced. But in fact there may be some songs that needn't to be sung by the bands he likes because only <var>#m#&lfloor;/#n#/#m#/&rfloor;</var> songs need to be sung by particular bands and the rest of them, which may include <var>#n#%#m#</var> songs, can be sung by any groups. And the RE is because I forgot to check if <var>#a#(_#i#_)&gt;#m#</var> before I put it into the counter array <var>#b#</var>. </p>
