<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>First of all, we find the maximum <math>v{a}</math> that <math>v{a}p{3}</math> is not greater than <math>v{m}</math>. And the first block must have side <math>v{a}</math> or <math>o{(}v{a}o{-}c{1}o{)}</math>. That is because if we use <math>o{(}v{a}o{-}c{2}o{)}</math> or smaller integers. It must be smaller than using <math>o{(}v{a}o{-}c{1}o{)}</math> because the first block can be replaced by a block with side <math>o{(}v{a}o{-}c{1}o{)}</math>. But why <math>o{(}v{a}o{-}c{1}o{)}</math> cannot be replaced by <math>v{a}</math>? Fox example, if we've an <math>v{m}</math> which equals <math>c{9}</math>, then <math>v{a}</math> would be <math>c{2}</math>. But we know that the maximum number of the blocks is <math>c{7}</math>, which is <math>o{(}c{1}p{3}o{+}c{1}p{3}o{+}c{1}p{3}o{+}c{1}p{3}o{+}c{1}p{3}o{+}c{1}p{3}o{+}c{1}p{3}o{)}</math>. So we may have more volumes to make a higher tower when we use the block with side <math>o{(}v{a}o{-}c{1}o{)}</math>. </p>
	<p>Secondly, I have to remind you that when you pick up a block of with side <math>v{a}</math>, the total volume of rest part should not be greater than <math>o{(}o{(}v{a}o{-}c{1}o{)}p{3}o{-}v{a}p{3}o{)}</math>, or this block is a illegal block because it is not the biggest block that can be taken. So when we choose to take the block with side <math>v{a}</math> or <math>o{(}v{a}o{-}c{1}o{)}</math>, the volume remained are very important. The more volume remained, the higher tower we can build. So we should pick up the larger one. </p>
	<p>After getting to know which block should we choose, we get the answer. After getting <math>v{m}</math>, repeat choosing the most suitable block and remove it from the maximum volume or reset <math>v{m}</math> until it is reduced to <math>c{0}</math>. </p>
