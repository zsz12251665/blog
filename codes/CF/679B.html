		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<section>
			<p>First of all, we find the maximum <var>#a#</var> that <var>#a#(^3^)</var> is not greater than <var>#m#</var>. And the first block must have side <var>#a#</var> or <var>(#a#-1)</var>. That is because if we use <var>(#a#-2)</var> or smaller integers. It must be smaller than using <var>(#a#-1)</var> because the first block can be replaced by a block with side <var>(#a#-1)</var>. But why <var>(#a#-1)</var> cannot be replaced by <var>#a#</var>? Fox example, if we've an <var>#m#</var> which equals 9, then <var>#a#</var> would be 2. But we know that the maximum number of the blocks is 7, with <var>(1(^3^)+1(^3^)+1(^3^)+1(^3^)+1(^3^)+1(^3^)+1(^3^))</var>. So we may have more volumes to make a higher tower when we use the block with side <var>(#a#-1)</var>. </p>
			<p>Secondly, I have to remind you that when you pick up a block of with side <var>#a#</var>, the total volume of rest part should not be greater than <var>((#a#+1)(^3^)-#a#(^3^))</var>, or this block is a illegal block because it is not the biggest block that can be taken. So when we choose to take the block with side <var>#a#</var> or <var>(#a#-1)</var>, the volume remained are very important. The more volume remained, the higher tower we can build. So we should pick up the larger one. </p>
			<p>After getting to know which block should we choose, we get the answer. After getting <var>#m#</var>, repeat choosing the most suitable block and remove it from the maximum volume or reset <var>#m#</var> until it is reduced to 0. </p>
