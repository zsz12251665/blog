<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>This problem required us to find out all the lakes, and according to the greedy algorithm, we will fill the smallest lakes with land until there are only <math>v{k}</math> of them left. But the problem is how to find out all the lakes. The answer is <abbr title="Depth-First Search">DFS</abbr>. What's more, you'll find the data range is just <math>c{1}o{&le;}v{n}o{,}v{m}o{&le;}c{50}</math> and <math>c{0}o{&le;}v{k}o{&le;}c{50}</math>. So what else do we need to worry about? The simulation is very enough. </p>
