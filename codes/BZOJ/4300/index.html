	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>When I read the problem the first time, I thought out a way like solving the longest increasing subsequence problem, which means I just need an array to keep the longest subsequence until this integer. However, when I submitted it to the online judge, the answer was <abbr title="Time Limit Exceed">TLE</abbr> because the time complexity is <data value="o{O}o{(}v{n}p{2}o{)}"></data> (You enumerate the elements along the sequence and check if the longest subsequence that ends with it can update the longest subsequence that ends with any element after it). Later, I got an acceptable algorithm whose time complexity is <data value="o{O}o{(}v{n}o{}o{lg}v{a}b{v{i}}o{)}"></data>. It just needs a <abbr title="dynamic planning">dp</abbr> algorithm, which <data value="v{dp}b{v{i}}"></data> keeps the length of the longest subsequence whose last integer's <data value="v{i}"></data>-th digit is not 0 in binary. So after reading an integer in sequence, we can find a longest subsequence that ends with it and update the <data value="v{dp}"></data> array with this subsequence in an <data value="o{O}o{(}o{lg}v{a}b{v{i}}o{)}"></data> algorithm. </p>
