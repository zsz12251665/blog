<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>When I read the problem the first time, I thought out a way like solving the longest increasing subsequence problem, which means I just need an array to keep the longest subsequence until this integer. The code is given as Solution 1 in the code part. </p>
	<p>However, when I submitted it to the judge, the answer was <abbr title="Time Limit Exceed">TLE</abbr> because the time complexity is <data value="o{O}o{(}v{n}p{2}o{)}"></data>. Later, I got another algorithm whose time complexity is <data value="o{O}o{(}v{n}o{}o{lg}v{a}b{v{i}}o{)}"></data>. It just needs a <abbr title="dynamic planning">dp</abbr> algorithm. <data value="v{dp}b{v{i}}"></data> keeps the length of the longest subsequence whose last integer's <data value="v{i}"></data>-th digit is not 0 in binary. So after read in each integer in sequence, I can update the <data value="v{dp}"></data> array in an <data value="o{O}o{(}o{lg}v{a}b{v{i}}o{)}"></data> algorithm. And that is Solution 2, which is accepted. </p>
