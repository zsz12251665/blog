<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>Tomorrow is Day 1 of NOIP 2017, so let's solve some easy problems to raise our spirits. \(&#8807;&#9661;&#8806;*)o</p>
	<p>The problem can be solved by enumerating the sum and the pair of numbers. However, the problem requires us to count the sums, not the pairs. So when we find a pair that their sum equals the number we're enumerating, we need to break two loops. So I compress the two loops into one that we will need just one break. </p>
