	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>The solution include a queue and a count array. We'll give every passenger an index according to when they appear. For example, the first passenger of the first ship has the first index. The <data value="v{nation}"></data> array will be used to keep their nationalities. The <data value="v{passenger}"></data> array will keep the indexes of the first passengers of the ships. Its size is <data value="o{(}v{n}o{+}c{1}o{)}"></data> since <data value="v{passenger}b{v{n}o{+}c{1}}"></data> will be used to keep the next integer of the index of the last passenger of all. In this way, the indexes of passengers on the <data value="v{i}"></data>-th arrived ship are from <data value="v{passenger}b{v{i}}"></data> to <data value="o{(}v{passenger}b{v{n}o{+}c{1}}o{-}c{1}o{)}"></data>. What's more, the <data value="v{time}"></data> array keeps the arrival times of ships. The <data value="v{count}"></data> array is used to keep the numbers of every nationality in the queue. And the queue, I think you have known the purpose, is used to keep the ships that arrived in 86400 seconds from the arrival of the last ship. </p>
	<p>When a new ship has arrived, keep the time of its arrival in the <data value="v{time}"></data> array. Then add the number of the passengers into the <data value="v{passenger}"></data> array and add the nationalities to the <data value="v{nation}"></data> array and the <data value="v{count}"></data> array. Then check if the head ship of the queue has been out of time. If it has, then remove the nationalities of the passengers on the head ship and check the next ship until the leaving time of the head ship is in the 86400 seconds. While adding nationalities, don't forget to refresh the answer when you found that <data value="v{count}b{v{i}}o{=}c{0}"></data>. After everything has been done, output the answer and wait for the arrival of the next ship. </p>
