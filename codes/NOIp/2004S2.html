		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<section>
			<p>Well, let's define that the bunches of fruits are <var>#fruit#(_1_)</var> to <var>#fruit#(_#n#_)</var>. And for every <var>#i#</var> in <var>[1,#n#-1]</var>, <var>#fruit#(_#i#_)</var> is smaller than <var>#fruit#(_#i#+1_)</var>. When we need to combine two bunches of fruits, choose <var>#fruit#(_1_)</var> and <var>#fruit#(_2_)</var> can keep the least cost since they are the smallest ones. And then we add the new bunch which is <var>(#fruit#(_1_)+#fruit#(_2_))</var> back to the <var>fruit</var> array. Now we have <var>(#n#-1)</var> bunches now. Repeat these steps, we can finally have a single bunch with least cost. </p>
			<p>What's important is that we can use a heap to keep the fruit array. The heap is a data structure with an <var>O(lg(#n#))</var> insert and an <var>O(lg(#n#))</var> extract. With the heap to keep the <var>#fruit#</var> array, we can reduce the time complexity to <var>O(#n#lg(#n#))</var>, which is fast enough to solve the problem. </p>
			<p>While building up the heap, I found a way to make fewer mistakes when extracting. That is fill the null part with maxlongint. That means if a point has no child, it has a child or two children with maxlongint. That can be very helpful because I don't need to judge if the point has child or not by the size of the heap. </p>
