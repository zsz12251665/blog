<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>I have to admit that the full arrangement confused me for a while, but later I found a way. I made a find function to find if there is another finger next to the finger I am using. If there is, it'll return the number of the next finger, or it'll return -1. If it return -1, it means that I need to carry on the previous bit. So the add function is used to add a number to the current bit. What's more, the used array is used to keep whether the finger is used or not so that I can find the next finger faster. That's the solution. </p>
