<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>The problem required not only a simulation but also more than a simulation. You'll find it <abbr title="Time Limit Exceed">TLE</abbr> without some optimizations. That is to reduce the time searching the room to the upper floor. It's not hard, just taking the remainder of every number on the board. You'll see that on the following codes. </p>
