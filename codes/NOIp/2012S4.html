<h3>Solution</h3>
<section>
	<p>This problem is completely a mathematical problem that asked the number-theoretic reciprocal. We can calculate it with the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is also called <abbr title="the extended Greatest Common Division algorithm">exGCD</abbr>. </p>
	<p>exGCD is an algorithm which is able to find a pair of <data value="o{(}v{x}o{,}v{y}o{)}"></data> that satisfies the B&eacute;zout's identity <data value="v{a}o{}v{x}o{+}v{b}o{}v{y}o{=}o{gcd}o{(}v{a}o{,}v{b}o{)}"></data>. Obviously, we have <data value="v{a}o{}v{x}o{&equiv;}c{1}o{(}o{mod}v{b}o{)}o{&hArr;}v{a}o{}v{x}o{+}v{b}o{}v{y}o{=}c{1}"></data>. Because the problem promised that it must have an answer, so <data value="o{gcd}o{(}v{a}o{,}v{b}o{)}o{=}c{1}"></data>, or there will be no number-theoretic reciprocal for this pair of <data value="o{(}v{a}o{,}v{b}o{)}"></data>. So the equation is a B&eacute;zout's identity. </p>
	<p>The standard Euclidean algorithm proceeds by a succession of Euclidean divisions whose quotients are not used, only the remainders are kept. However, for the extended algorithm, the successive quotients are used. We keep the quotients and put it back into the equation, we will have <data value="v{x}"></data> and <data value="v{y}"></data>. But attention! <data value="v{x}"></data> and <data value="v{y}"></data> may be negative numbers. So you need to change it into the minimum positive number, that is in <data value="o{[}c{1}o{,}v{b}o{-}c{1}o{]}"></data>. </p>
