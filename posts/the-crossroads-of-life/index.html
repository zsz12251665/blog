	<h2>June 19th: 1st day of Happy Time</h2>
	<p>After all, the examinations were over for a while. Now we can enjoy a few free days. So we planned to have a happy time, or the graduation trip. We booked a house in Nansha District on Airbnb. In the morning, I went to buy some beef and lamb for meals. At about 13:30, we met at Tee Mall and set off to our destination. At 16:00, we arrived. The dinner was hotpot today. Then we played billiard ball, table soccer, Mahjong, Sanguosha or Xbox 360 until 02:00. After all, I went to sleep at 03:00 (I heard that some people played until 05:00). </p>

	<h2>June 20th: 2nd day of Happy Time</h2>
	<p>Though we got to bed late, He Haolin still got up early. He bought some breakfast for us. The morning was almost over when everyone got up. So we ordered some McDonald's for lunch. In the afternoon, some of us went to Nansha Passenger Port, others including prepared food for the barbecue in the evening. We ate from 18:00 to 22:00. I also fried some noodles and vegetables. From 22:00 to 02:00, It was karaoke time. </p>

	<h2>June 21st: 3rd day of Happy Time</h2>
	<p>The karaoke was shut down automatically at 02:00. Because some people had fallen asleep, so we went to play Black Jack until 04:00. After that, we talked about how to deal with the rest of food because we would need to check out at about 10:00. It was 05:00 when I got to sleep. </p>
	<p>He bought us some breakfast again when I got up. Then in the morning, we packed up our belongings and count the fees. It was about 14:00 when we got to Zhujiang New Town. Some of us planned to play room escape after lunch, but we soon found that we were too tired to do so. </p>

	<h2>June 24th: the day when the score comes out</h2>
	<p>At 10:25, my phone rang. There was a message from the Educational Examinations Authority of Guangdong Province, telling me I got 595 in the <abbr title="National College Entrance Examination">NCEE</abbr> and ranked 9377 in the whole province. Later, I checked on the website, finding that my Chinese was 119, my Mathematics was 101, my English was 125 and my Science was 250. </p>
	<p>To be honest, I am a little up upset because I did not get over 600. My Chinese was beyond my expectation. But the Mathematics and English was not so high as I expected (though I have forseen that my Mathematics would be a mess). And the Science, in my opinion, has properly reflected my ability. </p>
	<p>In addition, the result of the self-admission exam was released too. Li Tao and Ye Yucheng was two of the ten students from Guangdong Province who was considered by <abbr title="Zhejiang University">ZJU</abbr>, but I was excluded. But <abbr title="South China University of Technology">SCUT</abbr> gave me an offer to their Mathematics School if my score was not at most 20 points lower than their simulated admission line. </p>

	<h2>June 28th: the university fair at school</h2>
	<p>There is a university fair at school. So most of us students came back to school. I was very plaesed to hear that 8 students from our school entered the top 50 students in Guangdong Province, including Hu Haoyu from our class (Class 1), Hu Jiahang, Ouyang Hao, Peng Chengzhi and Xu Zhaohui from Class 2, Wang Jiaqi and Zhang Yikai from Class 5. Other students also got a good score, such as Fu Peiyu, my classmate at primary school, getting 636 (She studied Liberal Arts), Liu Chengwu from Class 2 getting 677, and Huang Yijin from our class getting 676. </p>
	<p>After wandering in the fair meeting my schoolmates, Hu Haoyu, Hu Zhiyuan and I decided to leave to have lunch. W hen we went to picked Cai Tianlin, a candidate of the national team to the <abbr title="International Chemistry Olympiad">IChO</abbr> from Class 2, we found him as well as Zou Minghao, another student from Class 2, was arguing with the teachers from ZJU because ZJU abandoned the agreement with Zou Minghao and Luo Lingyu. They were selected during the <abbr title="Chinese Chemistry Olympiad">CChO</abbr>. According to their agreement, ZJU would give them an offer if they rich the undergraduate line in the NCEE. After all, Cai, Hu Haoyu, Hu Zhiyuan and I as well as Liang Yaoming, who we met on the way, had lunch together, playing jokes about ZJU. </p>

	<h2>July 1st: a meaningless day with the Informatics mates</h2>
	<p>In the morning, I went to my mother's office to print the aspiration list and the score certificate. Then I came to school to get the stamp of the school. After that, I went to the north gate of the SCNU to meet Fang and Liu as we decided. On the way I met Chen Yibing and Lou Yizhang, while I found that the dormitory buildings were being added lifts now. After meeting Fang Decheng and Liu Che, I went to the Admission Office of SCUT as well as Fang because he had some questions about the aspiration and I went to hand in the documents, while Liu stayed for another cuo of milk tea. It was not easy to find the office, but we finally made it after walking a long distance. The room escape would began at 16:30. So we ate some sushi as lunch and watched the movie "Spider Man: Far From Home". The film was okay. But the room escape was a little crowded because we had six persons, Fang, Liu, Wang Huaijie, Yang Xuelin, Zhan Fangrong and I, in such a small room. After the room escape, we went to Tai Hing Restaurant for dinner, where Mao Hongxi would joined us. We boasted, played some games, and talked about the future plan. Yang has already been considered by Stanford University before NCEE. Liu got 631 points in the NCEE and 84 points in the exam of <abbr title="Southern University of Science and Technology">SUSTC</abbr>. But he would be probably enrolled by <abbr title="Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)">CUHKSZ</abbr>. Zhan was no that lucky. He got only 561 points in the NCEE though he also passed the exam of SCUT. Fang got 580 points in the NCEE and he passed both the exam of SCUT and the exam of <abbr title="University of Electronic Science and Technology">UESTC</abbr>. At about 21:00, we went home. </p>
	<p>P. S. The water was stopped in the morning and I left the faucet on when I left home. Oh Jesus! </p>

	<h2>July 6th: waiting for the result of <abbr title="Hong Kong University of Science and Technology">HKUST</abbr></h2>
	<p>After all, the result of HKUST was released. I got the "Unsuccessful" I expected for over a week. But I was happy to hear that Yu Mukai, a friend from Shenzhen Middle School that I met in the <abbr title="RoboMaster">RM</abbr> Camp, has been admitted by the <abbr title="Division of Integrative Systems and Design">ISD</abbr>, HKUST on June 30th, while You Peixin has been admitted by Ecole Polytechnique on June 14th. And Ding Zhiyuan will go to <abbr title="City University of Hong Kong">CityUHK</abbr>. But I was not lucky like them. </p>

	<h2>July 9th: the day of the appreciation banquet</h2>
	<p>At 15:30, I arrived at the Royal Banquet in Gangding. The appreciation banquet would be held here at about 18:30. The preparation was soon finished. Then we played Sanguosha I brought for a while and bought some drinks. There were only 5 teachers attending the banquet today: Ms. Zeng Yiming the Chinese teacher, Mr. Zhang Qi the Mathematics teacher of Group B as well as the teacher of the Mathematics Olympiad, Mr. Wu Zhouwei the Mathematics teacher of Group A, Mr. Liang Houfu the English teacher and Mr. Luo Yuli the Biology teacher as well as the class teacher. As the representative of the parents, Wang Huijie's father made a speech about the 3-year life of senior high school. Then we gave some presents to our teachers. To our surprise, we found that Mr. Ruan Muhan, the Chemistry teacher as well as the grade teacher, was having dinner at the Royal Banquet with some other teachers too. So we also invited him to say something. During the banquet, I heard that Yang Shitong has been enrolled by <abbr title="Paris Institute of Political Studies">Sciences Po</abbr> and He Haolin was enrolled by <abbr title="University of Sydney">USYD</abbr>. Congratulations! After the banquet, we put on some songs as entertainment and took a photograph together. </p>

	<h2>July 15th: the day for the release of the result of the aspiration</h2>
	<p>I was waiting the train from Yangzhou to Nanjing when I received the message. It says that I has been enrolled by SCUT. My parents were happy to hear it because the uncertainties have gone. They soon send the news to my teachers and the other people keeping an eye on my study. But I was upset rather than happy to receive that because the persons nearby has gain a much better offer. Liu Che and Long Hanzhe was enrolled by CUHKSZ. Wang Shiqi, the "little" girl in our class, has been enrolled by ZJU. Fu Peiyu has decided to study in the Faculty of Business and Economics, <abbr title="Hong Kong University">HKU</abbr>, not to mention Yuan Lijia, who has been in Australia for more than a year. I can only comfort myself by telling myself that I have surpassed many classmates of my primary school and middle school. In addition, I have Fang Decheng with me in SCUT. The life was tough but we should look straight ahead, shouldn't we? </p>

	<h2>July 21st: release of the graduation map</h2>
	<p>I was "elected" as the designer of the graduation map. At 00:09, I received the data from Wang Shiqi (She was in Boston, USA, so it was 11:09 on July 20th there). In the afternoon, I began to beautify the blank map model I had prepared two weeks ago. But the coloring scheme was a big problem. I made several versions but none of them satisfied my classmates. They uploaded some schemes and I tried most of them. Can you imagine at least five <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr> facing only one developer? They kept vetoing an scheme and nominating another. Finally, I decided to listen to Wang. She asked me to debug a number of colours and fonts. Finally at 01:59 on July 22nd (Boston Time: 12:59 on July 21st), the releasing version of the graduation map "Queen's Vermilion" was completed as well as another four insider versions: red-and-yellow alpha version "Fried Eggs with Tomatoes", class uniform style limited version "Black Gold", advanced grey beta version "Sexual apathy" and the red-green-blue special version "Remote Sensing". Here are some highlighted facts about the data: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Our classmates could be found in 4 countries: China, France, the UK and the US (If He Haolin go to USYD in Australia next year, it will be 5 instead). </li>
		<li>Most students (13 of 40) stayed in Guangdong. Beijing took the second most students (11 of 40). Except these 2 provinces, the students in the same province went to the same university. </li>
		<li><abbr title="Peking University">PKU</abbr> took 6 students from our class, which was the most. The following is <abbr title="University of Science and Technology of China">USTC</abbr>, <abbr title="Sun Yat-sen University">SYSU</abbr> and SCUT. Each of them took 4 students. Then it comes to <abbr title="Tsinghua University">THU</abbr>, which took 3 students. </li>
		<li>3 of the 4 students in USTC have entered university last year. And the other one has gone to Class 6 in Senior 2. </li>
	</ul>
