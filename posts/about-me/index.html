		<p>This is zsz12251665 written here. I'm going to introduce myself to you in this passage. </p>
		<h3>Basic Information</h3>
		<p>My name is Zhong Sizhe. Zhong is my family name and Sizhe is my given name. The order is different because I am a Chinese. My hometown is Teochew, but I prefer to say that I'm from Canton because I've stayed in this ancient city for over 15 years. Why is 15 years? Well, I came to this city on June 7th, 2001, which is my birthday. I was born in the city, I had grown in the city, and I live in the city. It's not my hometown but much more like hometown. Since I'm a Chinese, I can speak my native language, Mandarin Chinese very fluently. At the same time, I can also speak English as this text you are reading, not native but nice too. Of course I can speak Cantonese, just okay, but no problems in daily life. In addition, I can understand Teochew dialect but I can't speak it. I'm very sorry because it is the language of my hometown. But I do have a few chances to use it. </p>
		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>Eh, let me think which to start. I like to play badminton or table tennis as a sport. Music is a good thing to relax myself or to raise my spirit, so I like to listen to music. Computers provide me a chance to making almost anything, so using it is also one of my favourites. I like doing some reading too because books show you the whole world. Oh, and staying with friends. With a friend, I have everything. Besides that, Mathematics, Physics and Informatics are my favourite subjects. By the way, my favourite animal is chipmunk. So you can see one on the home page of the blog. </p>
		<h3>Education Experience</h3>
		<p>In 2007, I started learning in Guangzhou Shuqian Road Primary School. I spent a happy 6 years there. I met a group of friendly classmates. Most of them are still my closest friends. After graduate, I went to Guangzhou Wuyang Middle School. To be honest, the students' level is not as good as my primary school classmates. However, they have their own field. Some are good at Computing, some are good at Literature, and some are good at Physics. I'm lucky that I can learn from them in those years. In 2016, according to my outstanding marks, I entered the Affiliated High School of <abbr title="Southern China Normal University">SCNU</abbr>, the best high school in Guangdong Province. The new classmates who sitting beside me are all the elites in study, in competitions, in anything. Now I am trying my best to catch up with them, to understand what they talked about everyday and to find my place among them. </p>
		<h3>Competitions &amp; Awards</h3>
		<p>In 2014, I first attended <abbr title="National Olympia Informatics in provinces">NOIp</abbr> in 2014 and won the 2nd prize of juniorh group in Guangzhou City. Next year, I got the 1st prize of junior group in Guangdong Province. This is much better than last year. But in 2016, after entered high school, I attended senior group. So I just got the 3rd prize in Guangdong Province this time while most of my schoolmate got the 1st or 2nd prize. </p>
		<h3>Contact</h3>
		<p>If you want to contact me, I use Tencent QQ, Wechat, Microsoft Skype and E-Mail. Of course telephone and <abbr title="Short Message Serivce">SMS</abbr> too. But you'd better let me know you by <a href="mailto:zsz12251665@163.com">E-Mail</a> first. </p>
