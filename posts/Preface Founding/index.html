		<p>Well, I'm happy that I have succeeded it building my first own blog after typing over 100,000 characters. It was not an easy job for a high school student. But now I am proud that zsz12251665's has been published. Now it is running on Github. Although it is not perfect enough, I am very satisfied with everything. </p>
		<p>This is a "hand-made" blog. All the themes, including the colours, the background images and the typesetting, even the little song boxes were designed by myself just with text editors like notepad++ and Atom(In fact, this is because the WYSIWYG editors like Adobe Dreamweaver or Microsoft Word always change my code form and make the indent a mess). It is really a nice work, isn't it? However, it was in HTML5 and CSS3 that I wrote the pages as static pages, so there are still some problems remain in the blog, such as different Chinese fonts can hardly to be used so that I have to use English in my blog instead of Chinese. As English is a foreign language to me, there must be some mistakes in grammars, spellings, expressions, etc. in my words. If you would like to <a href="mailto:zsz12251665@163.com">contact me</a> and point them out, I'll really appreciate it. Thank you very much! </p>
