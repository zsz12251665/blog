<p>Happy Chinese New Year! My little blog has come through 3 years! In 2019, zsz12251665's blog changed a lot. Now it is time to review it. </p>
<section>
	<h2>The domain</h2>
	<p>I am terribly sorry that I forgot to renew the free domain "zsz12251665.cf" and I would need to pay for it after it expired. Noticing that Wang Huaijie has hosted <a href="https://blog.jwhj.now.sh/">his blog</a> on <a href="https://zeit.co/">ZEIT</a>, I turn to it too. In the past, I deployed my page on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, using free domains from <a href="https://www.freenom.com/">Freenom</a> and enabled <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr> and <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr> via <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>. But now ZEIT provides a free deploying plan with HTTPS-enabled custom domains, continuous deployment with GitHub and high-performance Smart CDN. So I don't need to spend as much time to deploy my blog as I did before. </p>

	<h2>The <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr></h2>
	<p>You might noticed that our UI also got updated. We abandon the navigator bar and use little icons instead. We also separate the settings to a single page. </p>
	<details open>
		<summary>Homepage Comparison</summary>
		<div style="text-align: center;">

				<figcaption>Old UI, inspired by the card of the Material Design</figcaption>

				<figcaption>New UI, inspired by the plain of the Metro UI</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</details>
	<p>Inspired by the Metro UI from Microsoft, I dropped the card design from the Material Design because it did not seem like a card at all. The big plain design of the header and the footer makes the UI not as complex and weird as the large and conspicuous header and the tiny and unnoticeable footer. </p>
	<p>However, there are some problems here. The link colour is similar to the text colour. So some letters and icons at the header and footer might be unreadable in some themes. </p>

	<h2>The author</h2>
	<p>In 2019, I have passed the <abbr title="National College Entrance Examination">NCEE</abbr>, graduated from the Affiliated High School of <abbr title="Southern China Normal University">SCNU</abbr> and entered <abbr title="South China University of Technology">SCUT</abbr>. So I am not a high school student any more. I am a university student now. The university life provides me more spare time, but also provides me a lot of "side mission" to spend time on. As an <abbr title="Olympiad in Informatics player">OIer</abbr>, I joined the <abbr title="International Collegiate Programming Contest">ICPC</abbr> team in SCUT. Hope I can get more achievements than in high school. </p>
