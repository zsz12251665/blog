<h3>June 1st: 6 days before the NCEE</h3>
<p>I have failed to focus on study since May 24th, just after the third simulation exam of the NCEE. My heart told me to review the textbooks, complete the test papers and summarize the knowledge. But whenever I started, I felt sleepy or anxious and was unable to calm down to study. Maybe this is what we call <abbr title="posttraumatic stress disorder">PTSD</abbr>. </p>
<h3>June 2nd: 5 days before the NCEE</h3>
<p>Today my parents and I had lunch in Xingyun Lou Restaurant. In Chinese, "Xingyun" means fortune, hoping it will bring me good luck in the NCEE. We went there to celebrate my birthday in advance, which is on June 7th. </p>
<p>By the way, it was annoying that the air conditioner in the classroom was off in the evening. How can we bear it in such a hot evening? The temperature was 29 degree Celsius and the relative humidity was 89%! </p>
<h3>June 3rd: 4 days before the NCEE</h3>
<p>Today we began to have the last lessons in high school. They are the exhortations from our teachers. But to be honest, some of them are boring. Can you imagine that the whole grade have the Biology lesson together? How useless the class could be! The lecturer was emphasizing that we should take reviewing Biology as the most important task in the last 4 days. This is bullshit! </p>

<h3>June 4th: 3 days before the NCEE</h3>
<p>The photo on the right is the bunch of "flowers" to our Chemistry teacher, Mr. Ruan Muhan, who is also one of our grade teachers. The story happened in last term. It was on a Tuesday afternoon when he came to have a Chemistry lesson. He saw there was a paper package of an ice-cream cone on the teacher's desk, so he asked the student on duty to throw it away. But the next Tuesday, he saw two instead. He became very angry and shouted at all the class. So we started to collect those paper packages. Before the last lesson, we made this to thank him. It is a typical Class-1 style, isn't it? </p>
<p>P. S. Today is also a day who must not be named. </p>
<h3>June 5th: 2 days before the NCEE</h3>
<p>Today is the World Environment Day. It is also the last day we stay in the classroom, while students in other schools have returned home yesterday. Though all of us knew the day would come, it was still surprising to find that today is the last day. All the exercises, all the lessons, all the marks, all the moments, will be moved from the classroom into our hearts. But we will always remind the old days, especially the last dog days in Senior 3. The day after tomorrow, we will attend the NCEE. Hope that all of us will be able to enter our dream colleges. </p>
<h3>June 6th: 1 day before the NCEE</h3>
<p>Tomorrow will be the first day of the NCEE. Hope everything will be fine. That's all today. </p>
<p>P. S. Today is Grain in Ear. </p>
<h3>June 7th: 1st day of the NCEE</h3>
<p>Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, my 18th birthday and the first day of the NCEE. I got up at 06:45, left for school at 07:15 and arrived at 07:45. We are going to cross the Champion Bridge, hoping that we could be the champion in the NCEE (Before the exam of each subject, we will cross the bridge). At 08:30, the security guards allowed us to enter the school buildings. At 08:50, the exam paper was handed to us. At 09:00, the first examination, Chinese, began. It lasted for 2 hours and a half. In general, I thought I did it quite well. I managed to answer all the questions. However, the next one, Mathematics from 15:00 to 17:00 is not so good. Though the difficulty of the exam really met my convenience, my performance is a piece of shit. I failed to answer some problems due to my carelessness and impatience. I began to doubt whether I can reach the minimum requirement of <abbr title="Zhejiang University">ZJU</abbr> or <abbr title="South China University of Technology">SCUT</abbr>. But it is not the time to think of it. I have another two exams tomorrow! </p>
<h3>June 8th: 2nd day of the NCEE</h3>
<p>Today is better than yesterday. I finished almost all questions in the exam of Science from 09:00 to 11:30. And I even handed in the paper 5 minutes before the exam of English ended. But the end of the NCEE is not the end of entering university. The examination of ZJU will be held from June 10th to June 12th, while SCUT is on June 15th, <abbr title="Southern University of Science and Technology">SUST</abbr> is from June 16th to June 18th. And I am still waiting for the further information from <abbr title="Hong Kong University">HKU</abbr> and <abbr title="Hong Kong University of Science and Technology">HKUST</abbr>. Okay, I have to go to sleep right now. I need to get up early tomorrow to fly to Hangzhou. </p>
<h3>June 9th: from Guangzhou to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>We left for Hangzhou by air in the morning. Because the flight was delayed, we arrived in the downtown at about 13:30. After lunch, we got to our hotel which lies in Fengqi Road, took a rest, and then went to visit the Zijingang Campus, ZJU, where the examination will be held. In the evening, we had dinner in Zhiweiguan near the West Lake. What a tiring day! </p>
<h3>June 10th: 1st day in ZJU</h3>
<p>In the morning, we visited the Yuquan Campus, ZJU. Compared to Zijingang, the trees are much taller in Yuquan. This is mainly because Yuqian has a longer history. But both of these two campus have a moat. </p>
<p>In the evening, I came to Zijingang with my parents, had dinner in the canteen, and then attended the paper-based examination of ZJU from 18:30 to 21:30. It was a tough experience. I had no idea on half of the questions about Literature, found my vocabulary could only cover three quarters of the questions of English, and lacked the knowledge about angular momentum and electromagnetic wave. With guessing and inference, I finally managed to finished all the 88 questions. It was very late when we got back to the hotel. </p>
<h3>June 11th: 2nd day in ZJU</h3>
<p>At 08:30, the physical examination of ZJU started. Compared to when I was in high school, my score of the seated forward flexion test dropped 3 centimetres again, which was only 14.4 centimetres. The 50-metre sprint improved from 7.5 seconds to 7.3 seconds. The vital capacity was still around 3200 to 3300 (3278 this time). My height remained 174.5 centimetres but my weight increased to 58.5 kilograms. This brought my <abbr title="Body Mass Index">BMI</abbr> up to 19.1 (I was around 18 when in high school and 17 when in middle school). </p>
<p>In the evening, we walked around the West Lake. My interview tomorrow will be from 13:00 to 14:00 and I need to arrive 30 minutes earlier. Hope I could have good luck. </p>
<h3>June 12th: 3rd day in ZJU</h3>
<p>At 12:20, I came to the building where the interview would be held. At 13:00, I as well as another five students was led into the interview room. After a short self introduction, I learnt that the other interviewees comes from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan, Sichuan or Yunnan. The first question of the interview was to describe the Chinese writing questions and the topic of your writing. The second question was "If you would attend the NCEE later, when you can select subjects to take examinations, which one you would choose?". The third one was "If we make an ordinary material, such as copper, into nano-material, how would the melting point change?". The fourth was "When were you most stressed? How did you managed to fix it?". And the last question was "How would you sort this five words, diligence, intelligence, persistence, interest and opportunity?". The interview was held for an hour. When we six interviewees finally stood up, walked out the room and left the building, we took a long sigh with relief. The examination was over after all. </p>
<h3>June 13th: from Hangzhou to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Sleepy, I got up at 06:30 in the early morning. We checked out and left for Hangzhou East Railway Station for the train back to Guangzhou. The train G85 passed Hangzhou East at 08:50 and arrived at Guangzhou South Railway Station. What a tired trip! But luckily, I could have a break tomorrow. </p>
<h3>June 14th: a coffee break</h3>
<p>Today we planned a three-day trip as our graduation trip. We are going to stay in a house in the Nansha District from June 19th to 21st. We planned to have hotpot and barbecue there. But preparing the food is really a mess! </p>
<p>Today we are also excited to hear that Ecole Polytechnique, a famous university in France with schoolfellows like Cauchy and Le Chatelier, has offered a place to You Peixin, a friend who I met during the <abbr title="Dajiang Innovation">DJI</abbr> RoboMaster Summer Camp last year. Congratulations! </p>
<h3>June 15th: the day in SCUT</h3>
<p>At about 08:10, I left for the Wushan Campus, SCUT for the physical examination. Different from ZJU, SCUT only requires attenders to take three of the five tests and the attenders need to pass two or more. As we promised, I met You Peixin at the gate of the playground, and took the physical examination together. After the examination, I also saw Liu Che and Zhang Yipeng, two of my classmates (Liu studies Informatics and Zhang studies Biology). My father and I talked with Liu and his parents for a while. He told me that he came to SCUT at 07:30 and he just finished his interview. In the afternoon, he would leave for Shenzhen for the computer-based examination in SCUT tomorrow (I will take that too, but I will leave tomorrow). Then my father and I walked to the building in which I would have my interview at 13:00. There we met Fang Decheng, a schoolmate who also studies Informatics. He went to <abbr title="University of Electronic Science and Technology">UESTC</abbr> in the last a few days. Both Fang and Liu told me that the interview will be taken by five teachers to one interviewee, not including another teacher holding the timer. That's crazy! </p>
<p>At 12:45, I got back to SCUT again for the interview at 13:00. You and Zhang and Zhan Fangrong (another classmate who studies Informatics too) were in the same batch with me. Zhan and Zhang and I were the first group to be interviewed, which You was the last. The interview started with a self introduction for about 2 minutes. Then the interviewers asked some questions according to the introduction. The whole interview should take 8 minutes. </p>
<p>It was late now. I need to go to bed. The next post will be posted at the end of the month. </p>
