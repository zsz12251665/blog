		<h3>Wanted to know more about 404 Not Found? </h3>
		<p>The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found and 404 error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested. When communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a web browser request for a web page, with a numeric response code and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status code) message. In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as FTP and NNTP. </p>
		<p>Microsoft's IIS 7.0, IIS 7.5, and IIS 8.0 servers define the following HTTP substatus codes to indicate a more specific cause of a 404 error: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>404.0 - Not found</li>
			<li>404.1 - Site Not Found</li>
			<li>404.2 - ISAPI or CGI restriction</li>
